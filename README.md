# Trinity Zero Storage Password Manager

Well, it will never store your actual passwords.  I built this a few months back to no fanfare, and since I am not a business man, and I do not know how to sell a product, I have decided to just release it as open source software until the GPLv3, as I don't want all my hard work to just go unused.  **I am an idea man** *not a business man*.

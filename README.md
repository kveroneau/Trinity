# Trinity Zero Storage Password Manager

Well, it will never store your actual passwords.  I built this a few months back to no fanfare, and since I am not a business man, and I do not know how to sell a product, I have decided to just release it as open source software until the GPLv3, as I don't want all my hard work to just go unused.  **I am an idea man** *not a business man*.

Please note that the source for the unit `keysys` which is needed to compile the **Pro** version is not included, however, it shouldn't be difficult for a smart developer to replace the `DoubleKey` function it contains.

As this project is written in *FreePascal* with *Lazarus* as the GUI toolkit, it will compile on any operating system supported by these, which includes every mainstream operating system, and will also compile on Arm of course with zero effort.  I love FreePascal because of this, but everyone else just seems to insist on using other more complicated to cross-compile languages.  I prefer simplicity, I'm sorry, so no complicated *Go*, *C#*, *insert your fave language here*.  Instead, just download [Lazarus IDE](https://lazarus-ide.org/) for your operating system of choice, open the `.LPI` project file in it, and simply press the *Run* button, nothing complicated, super simple, just how I like it.
